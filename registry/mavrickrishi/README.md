# Rishi Mondal

I'm Rishi Mondal, a passionate developer from Chinsurah Hooghly, West Bengal, India.
I'm a maintainer at CNCF KubeStellar, GSoC contributor at UCSC OSPO, and a Docker Captain.
When I'm not breaking code and fixing bugs, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects,
participating in LFX CNCF programs, and helping the developer community grow.

## Modules
